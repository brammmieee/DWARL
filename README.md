# DWARL Package

## Getting Started
1. Make the setup.bash an executable by running `chmod +x setup.bash`
2. Run the setup.bash `./setup.bash` as superuser
    - Setup.bash installs the required system packages, set the environment variables, creates a python venv and install the required packages.
